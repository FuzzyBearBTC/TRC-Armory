TRC-Armory
==========

Adaption of the original BTC Armory code for Terracoins

Can run alongside the Bitcoin Armory wallet but please back all your wallets up as developers can not be responsible for 
lost or overwritten wallet files.

To install on linux run the following commands:

sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential pyqt4-dev-tools swig libqtcore4 libqt4-dev python-qt4 python-dev python-twisted
git clone https://github.com/FuzzyBearBTC/TRC-Armory.git
cd ./TRC-Armory
make
python ArmoryQt.py

and that's it!!!

You can use Armory for all of your Terracoin needs.  
It allows you to maintain multiple wallets, with or without encryption.  
Maintain offline wallets for maximum security from online attackers.  
Import addresses created with VanityGen or sweep funds from Casascius physical Terracoins.  
Toggle between “Standard” and “Advanced” modes to guarantee an appropriate set of options and information.  
And all this is available through an intuitive user interface that brings all the most advanced features of Terracoin
to your computer, without needing to be an uber-geek!

enjoy and if you have found this useful please donate to the developers
